# CSE-DS-1 Projects

CSE-DS-1 Projects is a collection of programs developed by Hardik Dagar during the CSE-DS-1 (Computer Science & Data Structures–1) first semester. This repository contains implementations created as part of regular coursework, practice exercises, and semester-based assignments.

The projects cover fundamental programming and data structure concepts such as arrays, strings, recursion, basic algorithms, and introductory searching and sorting techniques. The primary objective of this repository is to apply classroom concepts through hands-on coding and improve problem-solving skills.

Each program is written with a focus on clear logic, structured implementation, and readable code. Standard programming practices, including proper naming conventions and in-line comments, are followed to ensure ease of understanding and future reference.

This repository serves as a record of semester work, a revision aid, and a practice reference for core data structure concepts. It reflects consistent learning and practical exposure to foundational topics that form the basis for more advanced computer science subjects in later semesters.

Thank You!
